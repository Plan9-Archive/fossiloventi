This repo is a copy of fossil and its needed library and manpages, taken from the Bell Labs sources server. It contains no original code or modifications.

run INSTALL to add fossil to your 9front installation. I recommend using fossil in combination with Venti, making frequent archival snapshots, and storing the resulting rootscores. I find fossil+venti useful for its features, but I would not recommend using fossil alone and no matter what, backup your data. No warranties and don't blame me if there are issues. I believe there is a partially rewritten fossil in the 9legacy distribution, which you might try also.
